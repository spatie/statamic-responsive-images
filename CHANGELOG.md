### What's Changed

- Extensible dimension calculators by @ncla in https://github.com/spatie/statamic-responsive-images/pull/193
  
- - Developers now can customize the amount of images that get generated and their exact dimensions through a custom `DimensionCalculator` that developers bind in `ServiceProvider`. Calculations can be done for each breakpoint and source, and receive `Breakpoint` / `Source` in the calculation methods, which allows to access breakpoint parameters, original asset and more. For motivation and examples of this, please see the PR and the original issue associated with it.
